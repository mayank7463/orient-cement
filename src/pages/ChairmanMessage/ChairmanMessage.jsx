            <p className='py-4 text-xl font-bold'>Dear Shareholders,</p>
            <p className='py-4 text-2xl font-medium text-[#758191]'>It is a pleasure to share my thoughts with you at the end of yet another
                eventful year. Powered by the rich legacy of CK Birla Group, we now
                have a robust launchpad to embark on a journey towards an even more
                promising future for our customers, investors and all other stakeholders.
                Over the years, we have created a solid foundation for growth. We are
                now poised to elevate to the next level of sustainable value creation.</p>
            <p className='py-4'>While the Government’s thrust towards
                infrastructure creation and increase in
                private capex acted as tailwinds for the
                sector as a whole, the year had its fair
                share of challenges.</p>
            <p className='py-2'>The business landscape was
                    characterised by stubborn inflation for
                    a considerable part of the year and
                    sluggish demand scenario in some of
                    our core markets. Nevertheless, our
                    performance during the year has been in
                    line with the industry.</p>
            <p className='py-2'>We ended the fiscal year with total sales
                    volume of ~ 61 lacs metric tons. Our
                    overall margins continued to be strong
                    during the year, primarily led by our drive
                    towards premiumisation.</p>
            <p className='py-2'>towards premiumisation.
                    There has been a strategic shift in the
                    product mix. The premium products
                    ‘Birla.A1 OrientGreen Cement’ and
                    ‘Birla.A1 StrongCrete Cement’ have
                    fortified its position in the market,
                    resulting in a notable increase in market
                    share and revenue.</p>
             <p className='py-2'>We are crafting the next leg of our
                    growth journey with a premium
                    customer-centric portfolio, relentless
                    innovation across the value chain,
                    capacity expansions and above all ESGfocused
                    initiatives. Our focus towards
                    alternative fuels and raw materials (AFRs) has also helped us optimise our energy
                    costs during the year. Around 17% of
                    our total power consumption is now
                    from renewables, including waste heat
                    and the solar unit at Jalgaon, which will
                    increase significantly in the coming years.</p>
             <p className='py-2'>The stronger roots that we have developed
                    and the soaring heights that we plan to
                    scale are the result of the untiring efforts
                    and innovations of our rich talent pool. Our
                    people are our most powerful assets and
                    we have built a culture of high performance
                    and ownership. We have once again been
                    certified as a ‘Great Place to Work’ during
                    the year, which is a recognition of the
                    workplace culture that we have nurtured
                    over the years. Also, our MD and CEO,
                    has been recognised as one of India’s
                    Most Trusted Leaders by the Great Place
                    To Work Institute (India) for the second
                    time in a row.</p>
                <p className='py-2'>With agility at the core, we are excited
                    for the opportunities that lie ahead of
                    us. Lastly, I would like to thank all of our
                    stakeholders for their unwavering support
                    in our endeavours. As we grow together,
                    we hope to maintain this trust and belief.</p>
             <p className='py-4'>Warm Regards</p>
