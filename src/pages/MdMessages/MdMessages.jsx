                    <p className='py-4 text-2xl font-medium text-[#758191]'>We continue to create value for our customers and other stakeholders,
                        on the strong foundation and roots that we have built over the
                        decades. At Orient Cement, our long-term growth story continues to be
                        encouraging against the backdrop of India’s emergence as a strong and
                        resilient economy with accelerated infrastructure creation.</p>
                    <p className='py-4'>Having said that, the year gone by
                            (FY24) had its share of challenges for the
                            entire industry in terms of geopolitical
                            uncertainties, faltering market demand
                            and weak pricing environment.
                            Considering these challenges, our
                            performance was largely in line with the
                            sector as a whole.</p>
                    <p className='py-4'>We are focusing on upgrading our
                            existing manufacturing facilities as we
                            acknowledge that there is a pressing
                            need for immediate capacity addition.
                            We have already taken necessary steps
                            in that direction, the outcomes of which
                            will materialise during the upcoming
                            quarters.</p>
                    <p className='py-4'>Our revenues growth for the year at
                            8% is a combination of volume growth
                            and improved realisation per tonne due
                            to positive change in product mix. By
                            steadfastly increasing the sales of our
                            premium products and maintaining
                            a sharp focus on cost management,
                            we have been able to improve our
                            profitability significantly during the year.</p>
                    <p className='py-4'>am happy to share that our
                            premiumisation strategy is holding us
                            in good stead, mitigating the operating
                            challenges. It is very encouraging to
                            observe that there is a robust demand for
                            our premium products in our operating markets. As a result, we have managed
                            to grow our premium brand volumes by
                            31% in the year. Our premium brands
                            already account for approximately 21%
                            of total trade sales by volume and are
                            increasing consistently. When we talk
                            about our premium cement products, we
                            command some of the highest margins
                            in the market. This is a testament to
                            the significant value we deliver to our
                            customers.</p>
