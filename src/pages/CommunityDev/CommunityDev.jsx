             <p className='py-4'>We strengthened our focus on rural
                development by upgrading infrastructure
                in nearby villages. Our initiatives include
                building roads, culverts and other tertiary
                infrastructure in Devapur and neighbouring
                areas, along with youth skill development
                programmes. Additionally, efforts also
                extend to social tribal development,agricultural training and support during
                emergencies. Our social responsibility
                efforts focus on empowering communities.
                We established a Skill Centre in Dharwad,
                Karnataka, to equip women with valuable
                skills. In addition to this, construction
                projects such as roads, borewells and
                community halls improved the village
                infrastructure in places such as Saaleguda
                and Tudumgudem, near Devapur.</p>
